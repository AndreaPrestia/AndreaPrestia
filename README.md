### Hi there üëã, my name is Andrea Prestia and i love to write code :)  

I'm passionate about software engineering and i'm lucky that is also my daily job. 
I started programming at age of 13, with Javascript and C++. 
I have graduated in a software development focused high-school and joined the software engineering course in Rome's university.
In the meantime i started working as software developer at age of 20 as consultant. Currently i'm a freelance software engineer.
I like to understand how the things work together and how everything is running under the hood.
