## Hi there üëã, my name is Andrea Prestia and i love to write code :)  

<p> I'm passionate about software engineering and i'm lucky that is also my daily job. </p> 

<p>I started programming at age of 13, with Javascript and C++. </p>
<p>I have graduated in a software development focused high-school and joined the software engineering course in Rome's university. </p>
<p>In the meantime i started working as software developer at age of 20 as consultant. Currently i'm a freelance software engineer. </p>
<p>I like to understand how the things work together and how everything is running under the hood. </p>
