## Andrea Prestia  

<p> Software engineering is my strongest passion and I'm lucky that it has also become my job. </p> 

<p>I started programming at the age of 13, with Javascript and C++. </p>
<p>After my high-school studies focused on software development, I joined the software engineering course at the university, here in Rome (Italy). </p>
<p>Meanwhile, I started working as a software developer when I was 20. </p>
<p>I like understanding how things are built to work together and how everything is running under the hood. </p>
